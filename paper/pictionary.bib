  abstract  = {We present SketchREAD, a multi-domain sketch recognition engine capable of recognizing freely hand-drawn diagrammatic sketches. Current computer sketch recognition systems are difficult to construct, and either are fragile or accomplish robustness by severely limiting the designer's drawing freedom. Our system can be applied to a variety of domains by providing structural descriptions of the shapes in that domain; no training data or programming is necessary. Robustness to the ambiguity and uncertainty inherent in complex, freely-drawn sketches is achieved through the use of context. The system uses context to guide the search for possible interpretations and uses a novel form of dynamically constructed Bayesian networks to evaluate these interpretations. This process allows the system to recover from low-level recognition errors (e.g., a line misclassified as an arc) that would otherwise result in domain level recognition errors. We evaluated SketchREAD on real sketches in two domains---family trees and circuit diagrams---and found that in both domains the use of context to reclassify low-level shapes significantly reduced recognition error over a baseline system that did not reinterpret low-level classifications. We also discuss the system's potential role in sketch-based user interfaces.},

  abstract = {Free-hand sketch recognition has become increasingly popular due to the recent expansion of portable touchscreen devices. However, the problem is non-trivial due to the complexity of internal structures that leads to intra-class variations, coupled with the sparsity in visual cues that results in inter-class ambiguities. In order to address the structural complexity, a novel structured representation for sketches is proposed to capture the holistic structure of a sketch. Moreover, to overcome the visual cue sparsity problem and therefore achieve state-of-the-art recognition performance, we propose a Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) framework for sketch recognition, fusing several features common to sketches. We evaluate the performance of all the proposed techniques on the most diverse sketch dataset to date (Mathias et al., 2012), and offer detailed and systematic analyses of the performance of different features and representations, including a breakdown by sketch-super-category. Finally, we investigate the use of attributes as a high-level feature for sketches and show how this complements low-level features for improving recognition performance under the MKL framework, and consequently explore novel applications such as attribute-based retrieval.}
