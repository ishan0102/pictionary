# Pictionary
This is our final project for Computer Vision (EE 379V) at UT Austin. Our group members are Satya Boddu, Michael Chen, Udai Jain, Rishi Ponnekanti, and Ishan Shah.

This project seeks to use computer vision to recreate a computer-based game of Pictionary, in which a human player draws an image and the computer attempts to guess the drawing. We also plan on having the computer generate drawings for the player to guess using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

## Development
